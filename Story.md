Once upon a time in a small village called HSMA-on-sea, 
there lived a wise  
beekeeper named HAL. 
Every day, HAL 
would wake up
and dream of visiting space.
One day, while HAL 
was running through fields of wheat, 
they stumbled upon a golden bicycle.
To their surprise, the bicycle had magical powers that could make it fly.
Excited and a bit nervous, HAL decided to make like ET and fly that thing.
As HAL embarked on this new adventure, 
they met a serious fighter pilot 
named Arnie. 
Together, they faced many challenges, including a time travelling robot 
and deciding which is the correct way to eat a scone. 
Despite the obstacles, they grew strong and good at coding.

In the end, HAL 
and Arnie
managed to break the limit of the atmosphere. 
The village of HSMA-on-sea celebrated their success, 
and HAL realized that space wasn't even as good as Cornwall.

And so, HAL continued to live in HSMA-on-sea, 
always remembering the day they found the bicycle
and how it changed their life forever.
